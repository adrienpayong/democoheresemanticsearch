# democoheresemanticsearch

Use the Cohere platform to build natural language understanding and generation into your product with a few lines of code. Cohereâ€™s large language models can solve a broad spectrum of natural language use cases, including classification, semantic search, paraphrasing, summarization, and content generation. Through finetuning, users can create massive models customized to their use case and trained on their data.
This is a demo of [semantic search with Cohere](https://github.com/adrienpayong/democoheresemanticsearch/blob/main/SemanticSearchcohere.ipynb).

Cohere can also be used for:
